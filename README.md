# Selenium_JSON_Paramaterization

First, we have to add dependencies in the POM.xml file.

This project is based on selenium, JSON, Testng,Maven dependencies and Assertions.

-> In the first demo project, I have used datadriven,Data Driven is a methodology where a sequence of steps in the test script is run repeatedly against different input values fetched from the corresponding data source. It is one of the widely-used automation testing best practices for verifying the behavior and efficiency of tests when handling various types of input values.

-> In the second demo project, I have used testng methods,chrome webdriver and JSON.
1)The first is a collection of name/value pairs. It has other names in various programming languages but is the same structure. Whether you see it as an object, record, struct, hash table, or others, they all refer to the same thing. 
2)The second data structure is an ordered list of values. Again, this is a popular data structure that may also be called an array, vector, or list, just to name a few. 

-> In the third demo project, I have created multiple users using datadriven. First the chrome driver will open the website page and next It redirects to SignUp page and here the details have been taken automatically from the code and it gets verified and the creditenals will be created.

-> In the fourth demo project, I have updated the computer and deleted the computer.

-> In the fifth demo project, I tried to add and verify the code
